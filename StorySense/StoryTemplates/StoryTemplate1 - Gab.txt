I am in the [1,2] with my %$person%. 

#If(*)
{
We saw a %$object% lying around. It was [3] (Size) and it had a color of [4]. 
}
#else
{
It was a bright sunny day and while we were walking, we saw a [3] (Size) %$object% lying around with a color of [4]. 
}

I think that this is normally used for [5].  We then went to my friend’s house near the [1] to show her the %$object% we found but on our way we saw a poor man begging for food. I felt [6] so we gave him some. We then went ahead to show my friend the %$object%. Me and %$person% went home afterwards. 

THE END
