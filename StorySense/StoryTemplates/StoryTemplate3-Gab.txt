{
One sunny day, I lost my %$object% in the [1].
}
#else
{
One rainy day, I lost my %$object% in the [1].
}

I went to the [1] because usually it's found at the [1,2] and near the [2,3] but it's not there. Then I went to [2] and I still can't find it there. I asked some people around if they found it and a person named [4] said it was in the %$location%. I felt [5] that I found it.

THE END
