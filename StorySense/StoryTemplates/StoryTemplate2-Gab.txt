Today during lunch time, I felt very [1] so my friend and I just talked instead. %$possessive_pronoun% name is %&person% and %$pronoun% said that I can be a [2,3] someday. 
I told %$possessive_pronoun% that she can be a [2,3] because she is smart. 
Another friend of mine came and she said that she wants to be a %$job%. 
A %$job% is someone who does [4]. We went back to class afterwards as it was already time.
THE END
